The results will only include teardown eligible and tear-down-in-process mother tags for the divisions you have. Searching by barcode will always return one mother tag, but searching by tag can result in multiple matches, possibly in different divisions.
 
If the resulting mother tags are in multiple divisions, then a dropdown selector will require you to select which division the part belongs to. If there are numerous mother tag matches in a single division, two chevron arrow buttons will appear on the left and right of the mother tag section, allowing you to cycle through the matches returned.

The global filter text field in the top right corner of the child part table allows you to search for text across any column in the table. Additionally, you can export the data as a CSV using the blue download icon button. Clicking on the column header toggles the sort directions for each column.
